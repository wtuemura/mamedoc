NAME
       MAME - Multi-purpose emulation framework

SYNOPSIS
       mame [options] gamename

DESCRIPTION
       Started	in  1997 by Nicola Salmoria, MAME was originally intended as a
       series of emulators for individual games,  which  were  later  combined
       into  a	single	multi-game emulator. In the following years, MAME grew
       over and over up to the actual size, with more than 100 contributors to
       the project.

OPTIONS
   Core commands
       -help, -?
	      Displays current MAME version and copyright notice.

       -validate, -valid
	      Performs	internal validation on every driver in the system. Run
	      this before submitting changes to ensure that you  haven't  vio‐
	      lated any of the core system rules.

   Configuration commands
       -createconfig, -cc
	      Creates  the default mame.ini file in the current directory. All
	      the configuration options (not commands) described below can  be
	      permanently changed by editing this configuration file.

       -showconfig, -sc
	      Displays the current configuration settings.

       -showusage, -su
	      Displays	a summary of all the command line options. For options
	      that  are  not  mentioned  here,	the  short  summary  given  by
	      -showusage is usually sufficient.

   Frontend commands
       All  the  list commands below write info to the screen.	If you wish to
       write the info to a textfile instead, use  redirection.	 For  example,
       mame  -listxml  > ~/mamelist.xml writes the full list of supported game
       to file mamelist.xml in your home directory.

       -listxml, -lx [gamename|wildcard]
	      List comprehensive details for all of the supported  games.  The
	      output  is  quite long, so it is usually better to redirect this
	      into a file.  The output is in XML format. By default all  games
	      are  listed;  however,  you  can limit this list by specifying a
	      driver name or wildcard after the -listxml command.

       -listfull, -ll [gamename|wildcard]
	      Displays a list  of  game  driver  names	and  descriptions.  By
	      default  all  games are listed; however, you can limit this list
	      by specifying a driver name or wildcard after the -listfull com‐
	      mand.

       -listsource, -ls [gamename|wildcard]
	      Displays	a  list  of  drivers and the names of the source files
	      their game drivers live in. Useful for finding  which  driver  a
	      game  runs  on  in  order  to fix bugs. By default all games are
	      listed; however, you can limit this list by specifying a	driver
	      name or wildcard after the -listsource command.

       -listclones, -lc [gamename|wildcard]
	      Displays	a  list  of  clones. By default all clones are listed;
	      however, you can limit this list by specifying a driver name  or
	      wildcard after the -listclones command.

       -listbrothers, -lb [gamename|wildcard]
	      Displays a list of "brothers" or other drivers from same source‐
	      file.  By default all games are listed; however, you  can  limit
	      this  list  by  specifying  a  driver name or wildcard after the
	      -listbrothers command.

       -listcrc
	      Displays a full list of CRCs of all ROM images referenced by all
	      drivers within MAME code.

       -listroms, -lr gamename
	      Displays a list of ROM images referenced by the specified game.

       -listsamples gamename
	      Displays a list of samples referenced by the specified game.

       -verifyroms [gamename|wildcard]
	      Checks for invalid or missing ROM images. By default all drivers
	      that have valid ZIP files or directories in the rompath are ver‐
	      ified;  however,	you can limit this list by specifying a driver
	      name or wildcard after the -verifyroms command.

       -verifysamples [gamename|wildcard]
	      Checks for invalid or missing samples. By  default  all  drivers
	      that  have  valid ZIP files or directories in the samplepath are
	      verified; however, you can  limit  this  list  by  specifying  a
	      driver name or wildcard after the -verifyroms command.

       -romident
	      Attempts	to  identify  ROM files, if they are known to MAME, in
	      the specified .zip file or directory. This command can  be  used
	      to try and identify ROM sets taken from unknown boards. On exit,
	      the errorlevel is returned as one of the following:
	      0  all files were identified
	      7  all files were identified except for some "non-ROM" files
	      8  some files were identified
	      9  no files were identified

       -listdevices, -ld
	      Output the list of devices referenced by a given game or set  of
	      games.

       -listslots, -lslot
	      Output the list of available slots and slot devices for the sys‐
	      tem.

       -listmedia, -lm
	      Output the list of available media for the system.

       -listsoftware, -lsoft
	      Output the list of known software for the system.

       -verifysoftware, -vsoft [gamename|wildcard]
	      Checks for invalid or missing ROM images in your software lists.
	      By  default all drivers that have valid ZIP files or directories
	      in the rompath are verified; however, you can limit this list by
	      specifying a specific driver name or wildcard.

       -getsoftlist, -glist
	      Retrieve software list by name.

       -verifysoftlist, -vlist [softwarelistname]
	      Checks a specified software list for missing ROM images if files
	      exist for issued softwarelistname. By default, all drivers  that
	      have valid ZIP files or directories in the rompath are verified;
	      however, you can limit this list by specifying a specific  soft‐
	      warelistname (without .XML).

       -listmidi, -mlist
	      Create  a  list  of list available MIDI I/O devices for use with
	      emulation.

       -listnetwork, -nlist
	      List available network adapters.

   Configuration options
       -[no]readconfig, -[no]rc
	      Enables or disables  the	reading  of  the  config  files.  When
	      enabled  (which is the default), MAME reads the following config
	      files in order:
	      1. mame.ini
	      the main configuration file
	      2. name.ini
	      where name is your executable name, i.e. mame unless you changed
	      it  (e.g.  if you renamed mame to mame0137, the parsed file will
	      be mame0137.ini)
	      3. debug.ini, if the debugger is enabled
	      4. vector.ini, for vector games only
	      5. [driver].ini
	      based on the source filename of the game driver
	      6. [parent].ini
	      for clones only, may be called recursively
	      7. [gamename].ini
	      note this sometimes resolves to the same of the source driver
	      The settings in the later ini's override those  in  the  earlier
	      ini's.   So,  for  example,  if  you  wanted  to disable overlay
	      effects in the vector games, you can create  a  vector.ini  with
	      the  "effect  none"  line  in  it, and it will override whatever
	      effect value you have  in  your  mame.ini.  The  default	is  ON
	      (-readconfig).

       -[no]writeconfig, -[no]wc
	      Write  configuration  to	[driver].ini  on exit.	Default is OFF
	      (-nowriteconfig).

   Search path options
       Be careful to use the path, directory  and  file  options  in  mame.ini
       ONLY.  Otherwise,  the  outcome may be unpredictable and not consistent
       across releases.

       -rompath, -rp, -biospath, -bp pathname
	      Specifies a list of paths within which to find ROM or hard  disk
	      images.  Multiple paths can be specified by separating them with
	      semicolons.  The default is 'roms' (that is, a directory	"roms"
	      in the same directory as the MAME executable).

       -hashpath pathname
	      Specifies  a  list  of paths within which to search for software
	      hash files.  Multiple paths can be specified by separating  them
	      with  semicolons.   The  default is 'hash' (that is, a directory
	      'hash' in the same directory as the MAME executable).

       -samplepath, -sp pathname
	      Specifies a list of paths within which  to  find	sample	files.
	      Multiple	paths  can  be specified by separating them with semi‐
	      colons. The default is 'samples' (that is, a directory "samples"
	      in the same directory as the MAME executable).

       -artpath, -artwork_directory pathname
	      Specifies  a  list  of paths within which to find artwork files.
	      Multiple paths can be specified by separating  them  with  semi‐
	      colons. The default is 'artwork' (that is, a directory "artwork"
	      in the same directory as the MAME executable).

       -ctrlrpath, -ctrlr_directory pathname
	      Specifies a list of paths within which to  find  controller-spe‐
	      cific  configuration  files.  Multiple paths can be specified by
	      separating them with semicolons. The default  is	'ctrlr'  (that
	      is,  a  directory "ctrlr" in the same directory as the MAME exe‐
	      cutable).

       -inipath pathname
	      Specifies a list of paths within which to find .INI files.  Mul‐
	      tiple paths can be specified by separating them with semicolons.
	      The default is '/etc/mame/'.

       -fontpath pathname
	      Specifies a list of paths within which to find .BDF font	files.
	      Multiple	paths  can  be specified by separating them with semi‐
	      colons. The default is '.' (that is, search in the  same	direc‐
	      tory as the MAME executable).

       -cheatpath pathname
	      Specifies a list of paths within which to find cheat files. Mul‐
	      tiple paths can be specified by separating them with semicolons.
	      The default is 'cheat' (that is, a directory 'cheat' in the same
	      directory as the MAME executable).

       -crosshairpath pathname
	      Specifies a list of paths within which to find crosshair	files.
	      Multiple	paths  can  be specified by separating them with semi‐
	      colons.  The  default  is  'crosshair'  (that  is,  a  directory
	      "crosshair"  in  the same directory as the MAME executable).  If
	      the Crosshair is set to default in the menu, MAME will look  for
	      gamenamespecified  crosshairpath,  where # is the player number.
	      Failing that, MAME will use built-in default crosshairs.

       -pluginspath pathname
	      Specifies a single  path	within	which  to  find  plugins.  The
	      default is 'plugins' (that is, a directory 'plugins' in the same
	      directory as the MAME executable).

       -languagepath pathname
	      Specifies a single path within which to find language files. The
	      default  is  'language'  (that is, a directory 'language' in the
	      same directory as the MAME executable).

   Output Directory Options
       -cfg_directory pathname
	      Specifies a  single  directory  where  configuration  files  are
	      stored.	Configuration  files  store user configurable settings
	      that are read at	startup  and  written  when  MAME  exits.  The
	      default  is 'cfg' (that is, a directory "cfg" in the same direc‐
	      tory as the MAME executable). If this directory does not	exist,
	      it will be automatically created.

       -nvram_directory pathname
	      Specifies a single directory where NVRAM files are stored. NVRAM
	      files store the contents of EEPROM and non-volatile RAM  (NVRAM)
	      for games which used this type of hardware. This data is read at
	      startup and written when MAME  exits.  The  default  is  'nvram'
	      (that  is, a directory "nvram" in the same directory as the MAME
	      executable). If this directory does not exist, it will be  auto‐
	      matically created.

       -input_directory pathname
	      Specifies  a  single  directory  where input recording files are
	      stored.  Input recordings are created via the -record option and
	      played back via the -playback option. The default is 'inp' (that
	      is, a directory "inp" in the same directory  as  the  MAME  exe‐
	      cutable). If this directory does not exist, it will be automati‐
	      cally created.

       -state_directory pathname
	      Specifies a single directory where save state files are  stored.
	      Save  state files are read and written either upon user request,
	      or when using the -autosave option. The default is  'sta'  (that
	      is,  a  directory  "sta"	in the same directory as the MAME exe‐
	      cutable). If this directory does not exist, it will be automati‐
	      cally created.

       -snapshot_directory pathname
	      Specifies  a single directory where screen snapshots are stored,
	      when requested by the user. The default is 'snap'  (that	is,  a
	      directory  "snap" in the same directory as the MAME executable).
	      If this directory does not exist, it will be automatically  cre‐
	      ated.

       -diff_directory pathname
	      Specifies a single directory where hard drive differencing files
	      are stored. Hard drive differencing files store any data that is
	      written  back  to  a  hard  disk image, in order to preserve the
	      original image. The differencing files are  created  at  startup
	      when  a game with a hard disk image. The default is 'diff' (that
	      is, a directory "diff" in the same directory as  the  MAME  exe‐
	      cutable). If this directory does not exist, it will be automati‐
	      cally created.

       -comment_directory pathname
	      Specifies a single directory where debugger  comment  files  are
	      stored.  Debugger comment files are written by the debugger when
	      comments are added to the disassembly for a game. The default is
	      'comments'  (that  is, a directory "comments" in the same direc‐
	      tory as the MAME executable).  If this directory does not exist,
	      it will be automatically created.

   State/playback options
       -state slot
	      Immediately  after  starting  the specified game, will cause the
	      save state in the specified slot to be loaded.

       -[no]autosave
	      When enabled, automatically creates a save state file when exit‐
	      ing  MAME  and  automatically  attempts  to reload it when later
	      starting MAME with the same game. This only works for games that
	      have  explicitly enabled save state support in their driver. The
	      default is OFF (-noautosave).

       -playback, -pb filename
	      Specifies a file from which  to  play  back  a  series  of  game
	      inputs.  This  feature does not work reliably for all games, but
	      can be used to watch a previously  recorded  game  session  from
	      start  to finish. In order to make things consistent, you should
	      only record and playback with all  configuration	(.cfg),  NVRAM
	      (.nv),  and  memory  card files deleted. The default is NULL (no
	      playback).

       -[no]exit_after_playback
	      If play back is enabled (see -playback option) the program exits
	      when end of file is reached. Otherwise the machine will continue
	      to run.  Default is OFF (-noexit_after_playback).

       -record, -rec filename
	      Specifies a file to record all input from a game	session.  This
	      can  be  used  to record a game session for later playback. This
	      feature does not work reliably for all games, but can be used to
	      watch  a	previously recorded game session from start to finish.
	      In order to make things consistent, you should only  record  and
	      playback	with all configuration (.cfg), NVRAM (.nv), and memory
	      card files deleted. The default is NULL (no recording).

       -[no]record_timecode
	      Specify whether to create a timecode file. It  contains  a  line
	      with  elapsed  times  on	each  press  of  timecode shortcut key
	      (default is F12).  This option works only when recording mode is
	      enabled  (-record  option).   The  file  is saved on inp folder.
	      Default is OFF (-norecord_timecode).

       -mngwrite filename
	      Writes each video frame to the given  filename  in  MNG  format,
	      producing  an animation of the game session. Note that -mngwrite
	      only writes video frames; it does not save any audio  data.  Use
	      -wavwrite for that, and reassemble the audio/video using offline
	      tools. The default is NULL (no recording).

       -aviwrite filename
	      Stream video and sound data to the given filename in AVI format,
	      producing  an animation of the game session complete with sound.
	      The default is NULL (no recording).

       -wavwrite filename
	      Writes the final mixer output to the given filename in WAV  for‐
	      mat,  producing  an audio recording of the     game session. The
	      default is NULL (no recording).

       -snapname string
	      Describes how MAME should name files for snapshots. string  pro‐
	      vides a template that is used to generate a filename. Three sim‐
	      ple substitutions are provided: the / character  represents  the
	      path  separator  on any target platform (even Windows); the lit‐
	      eral %g represents the driver name of the current game; and  the
	      literal  %i  represents an incrementing index. If %i is omitted,
	      then each snapshot taken will overwrite the previous one; other‐
	      wise,  MAME  will  find the next empty value for %i and use that
	      for a filename. The default is %g/%i, which creates  a  separate
	      folder  for each game, and names the snapshots under it starting
	      with 0000 and increasing from there. Example: if	you  use  mame
	      robby   -snapname   foo/%g%i   snapshots	 will	be   saved  as
	      snaps/foo/robby0000.png, snaps/foo/robby0001.png and so on.

       -snapsize widthxheight
	      Hard-codes the  size  for  snapshots  and  movie	recording.  By
	      default,	MAME will create snapshots at the game's current reso‐
	      lution in raw pixels, and  will  create  movies  at  the	game's
	      starting	resolution  in raw pixels. If you specify this option,
	      then MAME will create both snapshots  and  movies  at  the  size
	      specified,  and  will bilinear filter the result. Note that this
	      size does not automatically rotate if  the  game	is  vertically
	      oriented. The default is 'auto'.

       -snapview internal|auto|viewname
	      Specifies  the  view to use when rendering snapshots and movies.
	      By default, both use a special 'internal' view, which renders  a
	      separate snapshot per screen or renders movies only of the first
	      screen. By specifying this option, you can override this default
	      behavior	and  select a single view that will apply to all snap‐
	      shots and movies.  Note that viewname does not need to be a per‐
	      fect  match;  rather,  it  will select the first view whose name
	      matches all the characters specified by viewname.  For  example,
	      -snapview  native  will  match  the  "Native  (15:14)" view even
	      though it is not a perfect match.  viewname can also be  'auto',
	      which  selects  the  first  view	with  all screens present. The
	      default value is 'internal'.

       -[no]snapbilinear
	      Specify whether snapshot/movie should  have  bilinear  filtering
	      applied.	Default is ON (-snapbilinear).

       -statename string
	      Describes  how  MAME  should store save state files, relative to
	      the state_directory path. string provides  a  template  that  is
	      used  to	generate a relative path. Two simple substitutions are
	      provided: the / character represents the path separator  on  any
	      target  platform	(even  Windows); the literal %g represents the
	      driver name of the current game. The default is '%g', which cre‐
	      ates  a  separate folder for each game. Example: if you use mame
	      robby -statename	foo/%g	save  states  will  be	stored	inside
	      sta/foo/robby/.

       -[no]burnin
	      Tracks  brightness  of  the screen during play and at the end of
	      emulation generates a PNG that can be used to  simulate  burn-in
	      effects  on  other games. The resulting PNG is created such that
	      the least used-areas  of	the  screen  are  fully  white	(since
	      burned-in  areas	are darker, all other areas of the screen must
	      be lightened a touch).  The intention is that this  PNG  can  be
	      loaded  via an artwork file with a low alpha (e.g, 0.1-0.2 seems
	      to work well) and blended over the entire screen. The PNG  files
	      are    saved   in   the	snap   directory   under   the	 game‐
	      name\burnin-<screen.name>.png. The default is OFF (-noburnin).

   Performance options
       -[no]autoframeskip, -[no]afs
	      Automatically determines the frameskip level while you're  play‐
	      ing  the	game,  adjusting it constantly in a frantic attempt to
	      keep the game running at full speed. Turning this  on  overrides
	      the  value you have set for -frameskip below. The default is OFF
	      (-noautoframeskip).

       -frameskip, -fs value
	      Specifies the frameskip value (autoframeskip must be  disabled).
	      This  is	the number of frames out of every 12 to drop when run‐
	      ning. For example, if you say -frameskip 2, then MAME will  dis‐
	      play  10	out  of every 12 frames. By skipping those frames, you
	      may be able to get full speed  in  a  game  that	requires  more
	      horsepower than your computer has. The default value is 0, which
	      skips no frames.

       -seconds_to_run, -str value
	      This option can be used for benchmarking and automated  testing.
	      It tells MAME to stop execution after a fixed number of seconds.
	      By combining this  with  a  fixed  set  of  other  command  line
	      options,	you can set up a consistent environment for benchmark‐
	      ing MAME performance. In addition, upon exit,  the  -str	option
	      will  write a screenshot called final.png to the game's snapshot
	      directory.

       -[no]throttle
	      Configures the default thottling setting. When throttling is on,
	      MAME  attempts  to  keep the game running at the game's intended
	      speed. When throttling is off, MAME runs the game as fast as  it
	      can.  Note that the fastest speed is more often than not limited
	      by your graphics card, especially for older games.  The  default
	      is ON (-throttle).

       -[no]sleep
	      Allows  MAME  to	give time back to the system when running with
	      -throttle.  This allows other programs to have  some  CPU  time,
	      assuming	that the game isn't taxing 100% of your CPU resources.
	      This option can potentially  cause  hiccups  in  performance  if
	      other  demanding	programs  are  running.   The  default	is  ON
	      (-sleep).

       -speed value
	      Controls the speed of gameplay, relative	to  realtime;  smaller
	      numbers are slower. Default is 1.00.

       -[no]refreshspeed, -[no]rs
	      Automatically adjusts the -speed parameter to keep the effective
	      refresh rate below that  of  the	lowest	screen	refresh  rate.
	      Default is OFF (-norefreshspeed).

       -numprocessors, -np value
	      Set  number  of processors; this overrides the number the system
	      reports.

       -bench value
	      Benchmark for the given  number  of  emulated  seconds;  implies
	      -video none -sound none -nothrottle.

       -[no]sdlvideofps
	      Show SDL video performance. Default is OFF (-nosdlvideofps).

   Rotation options
       -[no]rotate
	      Rotate the game to match its normal state (horizontal/vertical).
	      This ensures that  both  vertically  and	horizontally  oriented
	      games show up correctly without the need to rotate your monitor.
	      If you want to keep the game displaying 'raw' on the screen  the
	      way  it  would  have  in	the  arcade, turn this option OFF. The
	      default is ON (-rotate).

       -[no]ror | -[no]rol
	      Rotate  the  game  screen  to  the  right  (clockwise)  or  left
	      (counter-  clockwise)  relative  to  either its normal state (if
	      -rotate is specified) or its native state (if -norotate is spec‐
	      ified).  Default for both is OFF (-noror -norol).

       -[no]autoror | -[no]autorol
	      These  options  are  designed for use with pivoting screens that
	      only pivot in a single direction. If  your  screen  only	pivots
	      clockwise,  use  -autorol  to ensure that the game will fill the
	      screen either horizontally or vertically in one  of  the	direc‐
	      tions you can handle.  If your screen only pivots counter-clock‐
	      wise, use -autoror.  Default for both is OFF (-noautoror	-noau‐
	      torol).

       -[no]flipx -[no]flipy
	      Flip  (mirror)  the  game screen either horizontally (-flipx) or
	      vertically (-flipy). The flips are applied after the -rotate and
	      -ror/-rol   options  are	applied.   Default  for  both  is  OFF
	      (-noflipx -noflipy).

   Artwork options
       -[no]artwork_crop, -[no]artcrop
	      Enable cropping of artwork to the game screen  area  only.  This
	      option  can also be controlled via the Video Options menu in the
	      user interface. The default is OFF (-noartwork_crop).

       -[no]use_backdrops, -[no]backdrop
	      Enables/disables the display of backdrops.  The  default	is  ON
	      (-use_backdrops).

       -[no]use_overlays, -[no]overlay
	      Enables/disables	the  display  of  overlays.  The default is ON
	      (-use_overlays).

       -[no]use_bezels, -[no]bezel
	      Enables/disables the  display  of  bezels.  The  default	is  ON
	      (-use_bezels).

       -[no]use_cpanels, -[no]cpanel
	      Enables/disables	the  display  of  cpanels.  The  default is ON
	      (-use_bezels).

       -[no]use_marquees, -[no]marquee
	      Enables/disables the display of  marquees.  The  default	is  ON
	      (-use_bezels).

   Screen options
       -brightness value
	      Controls	the  default  brightness,  or black level, of the game
	      screens.	This option does not affect the artwork or other parts
	      of the display.  Using the MAME UI, you can individually set the
	      brightness for each game screen; this option controls  the  ini‐
	      tial  value  for all visible game screens. The standard value is
	      1.0. Selecting lower values (down to 0.1) will produce  a  dark‐
	      ened  display,  while  selecting	higher values (up to 2.0) will
	      give a brighter display. The default is 1.0.

       -contrast value
	      Controls the contrast, or white level, of the game screens. This
	      option  does  not  affect the artwork or other parts of the dis‐
	      play. Using the MAME UI, you can individually set  the  contrast
	      for each game screen; this option controls the initial value for
	      all visible game screens. The standard value is  1.0.  Selecting
	      lower  values (down to 0.1) will produce a dimmer display, while
	      selecting higher values (up to 2.0) will give a  more  saturated
	      display. The default is 1.0.

       -gamma value
	      Controls the gamma, which produces a potentially nonlinear black
	      to white ramp, for the game screens. This option does not affect
	      the  artwork  or	other parts of the display. Using the MAME UI,
	      you can individually set the gamma for each  game  screen;  this
	      option  controls the initial value for all visible game screens.
	      The standard value is 1.0, which gives a linear ramp from  black
	      to white. Selecting lower values (down to 0.1) will increase the
	      nonlinearity toward black, while selecting higher values (up  to
	      3.0)  will  push	the  nonlinearity toward white. The default is
	      1.0.

       -pause_brightness value
	      This controls the brightness level  when	MAME  is  paused.  The
	      default value is 0.65.

       -effect [none|filename[.png]]
	      Name of a PNG file to use for visual effects, or 'none'. Default
	      is 'none'.

   Vector rendering options
       -beam_width_min value

       -beam_width_max value
	      Sets the minimum and maximum width of the  vectors.  This  is  a
	      scaling  factor  against	the  standard  vector  width, which is
	      interpolated between minimum and maximum according to the beam's
	      intensity.  A  value  of	1.0  will keep the default vector line
	      width. Smaller values will reduce the width, and	larger	values
	      will increase the width. The default is 1.0.

       -beam_intensity_weight value
	      Applies  an  exponential	weight to the minimum and maximum beam
	      width. For positive values the interpolated scaling factor  will
	      affect  lines  with  higher intensity more than lines with lower
	      intensity. The default is 0.0.

       -flicker value
	      Simulates a vector "flicker" effect, similar to a vector monitor
	      that  needs adjustment. This option requires a float argument in
	      the range of 0.00-100.00 (0=none, 100=maximum). The  default  is
	      0.

   Video options
       -video [soft|opengl|none]
	      Specifies which video subsystem to use for drawing:
	      soft  uses software rendering, which is slower but more compati‐
	      ble.
	      opengl  uses OpenGL and your graphics accelerator  to  speed  up
	      many  aspects  of  drawing  MAME	including compositing artwork,
	      overlays, and bezels, as well as stretching  the	image  to  fit
	      your screen.  output on some cards.
	      none  does no drawing and is intended for CPU benchmarking.
	      Default is 'soft'.

       -numscreens [1-4]
	      Number of screens to create; usually, you want just one. Default
	      is '1'.

       -[no]window, -[no]w
	      Run MAME in either full screen or a window. This is a fully-fea‐
	      tured window mode where the window resizes as necessary to track
	      what the game does.  And you can resize it  yourself  with  your
	      OS's standard window controls.  The default is OFF (-nowindow).

       -[no]maximize, -[no]max
	      Controls	initial window size in windowed mode. If it is set on,
	      the window will initially be set to the maximum  supported  size
	      when  you start MAME. If it is turned off, the window will start
	      out at the smallest supported size.  This  option  only  has  an
	      effect when the -window option is used. The default is ON (-max‐
	      imize).

       -[no]keepaspect, -[no]ka
	      Forces the correct aspect ratio. This means when you're resizing
	      the window in windowed mode the actual game image will resize in
	      discrete steps to maintain the proper shape of the  game	graph‐
	      ics.  If you turn this off you can resize the window to anything
	      you like and get	funny  squishing  and  stretching.   The  same
	      applies for full-screen. Default is ON (-keepaspect).

       -[no]unevenstretch, -[no]ues
	      Allow  non-integer  stretch  factors.  Video purists should stay
	      far, far away from this option,  while  everyone	else  will  be
	      happy  to  know  that  it  lets  you fill the screen properly in
	      full-screen mode. Default is ON (-unevenstretch).

       -[no]unevenstretchx, -[no]uesx
	      Act as -[no]unevenstretch on horizontal basis only.

       -[no]intoverscan, -[no]ios
	      Allow overscan on integer scaled targets.

       -intscalex, -sx
	      Set horizontal integer scale factor.

       -intscaley, -sy
	      Set vertical integer scale factor.

       -[no]centerh
	      Center horizontally within the view area. Default is  ON	(-cen‐
	      terh).

       -[no]centerv
	      Center  vertically  within  the  view area. Default is ON (-cen‐
	      terv).

       -[no]waitvsync, -[no]vs
	      Enable waiting for the start of VBLANK before flipping  screens;
	      reduces tearing effects. Default is OFF (-nowaitvsync).

       -[no]syncrefresh, -[no]srf
	      Enable  using  the start of VBLANK for throttling instead of the
	      game time.  Default is OFF (-nosyncrefresh).

   Software video rendering subsystem options
       NOTE: All the options in this group are	available  only  with  softare
       video rendering subsystem, i.e -video soft.

       -prescale [value]
	      Scale screen rendering by this amount in software. Default is 1.

       -scalemode, -sm [none|async|yv12|yuy2|yv12x2|yuy2x2]
	      Hardware scaling mode.
	      none    use software rendering.
	      async   async overlay.
	      yv12    yv12 overlay.
	      yuy2    yuy2 overlay.
	      yv12x2  yv12 overlay using x2 prescaling.
	      yuy2x2  yuy2 overlay using x2 prescaling.
	      Default is NONE.

   OpenGL video rendering subsystem options
       NOTE:  All  the	options  in  this group are available only with OpenGL
       video rendering subsystem, i.e -video opengl.

       -[no]filter, -[no]glfilter, -[no]flt
	      Enable bilinear filtering on screen output. Default is ON (-fil‐
	      ter).

       -prescale [value]
	      Scale screen rendering by this amount in software. Default is 1.

       -[no]gl_forcepow2texture
	      Force power of two textures. Default is OFF (-nogl_forcepow2tex‐
	      ture).

       -[no]gl_notexturerect
	      Don't use OpenGL GL_ARB_texture_rectangle. Turn off  if  corrup‐
	      tion  occurs  in	OpenGL mode, at cost of some performance loss.
	      Default is ON (-gl_notexturerect).

       -[no]gl_vbo
	      Enable OpenGL VBO, if available,	for  a	performance  increase.
	      Turn off if corruption occurs. Default is ON (-gl_vbo).

       -[no]gl_pbo
	      Enable  OpenGL  PBO,  if	available, for a performance increase.
	      Turn off if corruption occurs. Default is ON (-gl_pbo).

       -[no]gl_glsl
	      Enable OpenGL GLSL, if available, for  a	performance  increase.
	      Default is OFF (-nogl_glsl).

       -gl_glsl_filter value
	      Enable  OpenGL  GLSL  filtering instead of FF filtering 0=plain,
	      1=bilinear.  Default is 1: bilinear.

       -glsl_shader_mame[0-9]
	      Preferred custom OpenGL GLSL shader set mame bitmap (from  0  to
	      9).

       -glsl_shader_screen[0-9]
	      Preferred custom OpenGL GLSL shader screen bitmap (from 0 to 9).

       -screen
	      Explicit	name  for  all screens; 'auto' here will try to make a
	      best guess.

       -aspect, -screen_aspect
	      Aspect ratio for all screens; 'auto' here will  try  to  make  a
	      best guess.

       -resolution, -r
	      Preferred   resolution   for  all  screens;  format  is  widthx‐
	      height[@refreshrate] or 'auto'.

       -view  Preferred view for all screens

       -screen[0-3]
	      Explicit name of the  first|second|third|fourth  screen;	'auto'
	      here will try to make a best guess.

       -aspect[0-3]
	      Aspect  ratio  of  the  first|second|third|fourth screen; 'auto'
	      here will try to make a best guess.

       -resolution[0-3], -r[0-3]
	      Preferred resolution for the  first|second|third|fourth  screen;
	      format is widthxheight[@refreshrate] or 'auto'.

       -view[0-3]
	      Preferred view for the first|second|third|fourth screen.

   BGFX post-processing options
       NOTE:  All the options in this group are available only when BGFX video
       post-processing is enabled, i.e -video bgfx.  For  full	info  on  BGFX
       please visit official MAME documentation page:
       http://docs.mamedev.org/advanced/bgfx.html

       -bgfx_path pathname
	      This is where your BGFX shader files are stored.	The default is
	      'bgfx' (that is, a directory "bgfx" in the same directory as the
	      MAME executable).

       -bgfx_backend auto|opengl
	      Selects  a  rendering  backend  for  BGFX to use. The default is
	      'auto', which will let MAME choose the best selection for you.

       -bgfx_debug
	      Enables BGFX debugging features. Most users will not need to use
	      this.

       -bgfx_screen_chains default|unfiltered|hlsl[,...]
	      This  dictates  how  to  handle  BGFX rendering on a per-display
	      basis.  For each display specify one of the possible choices:
	      default	  default bilinear filterered output
	      unfiltered  nearest neighbor unfiltered output
	      hlsl	  HLSL display simulation through shaders
	      Separate directives for each window with a  comma  (,)  and  for
	      each  physical screen with a colon (:). For example, for an emu‐
	      lated game with 3 displays emulated on 3 windows on  your  moni‐
	      tor, -bgfx_screen_chains default,unfiltered,default specifies to
	      apply default filter on what is been rendered on the  first  and
	      third  window  and leave the content of the second window unfil‐
	      tered.

       -bgfx_shadow_mask filename
	      This specifies the shadow  mask  effect  PNG  file.  Default  is
	      'slot-mask.png'.

       -bgfx_avi_name filename
	      This specifies a filename for BGFX output logging.

   Full screen options
       -[no]switchres
	      Affects full screen mode only. Chooses if MAME can try to change
	      the screen resolution (color depth is normally left alone)  when
	      in  full-screen  mode.  If it's off, you always get your desktop
	      resolution in full-screen mode (which can be useful  for	LCDs).
	      Default is OFF (-noswitchres).

       -[no]useallheads
	      Split full screen image across monitors. Default is OFF (-nouse‐
	      allheads).

   Sound options
       -[no]sound
	      Enable or disable sound altogether. The default is ON (-sound).

       -samplerate, -srf value
	      Sets the audio sample rate. Smaller values  (e.g.  11025)  cause
	      lower  audio  quality  but faster emulation speed. Higher values
	      (e.g. 48000) cause higher audio  quality	but  slower  emulation
	      speed. The default is 48000.

       -[no]samples
	      Use samples if available. The default is ON (-samples).

       -volume, -vol value
	      Sets  the  startup volume. It can later be changed with the user
	      interface (see Keys section). The volume is  an  attenuation  in
	      dB:  e.g.,  "-volume -12" will start with -12dB attenuation. The
	      default is 0.

       -audio_latency value
	      This controls the amount of latency built into the audio stream‐
	      ing.   The  latency  parameter controls the lower threshold. The
	      default is 1 (meaning lower=1/5 and  upper=2/5).	Set  it  to  2
	      (-audio_latency  2) to keep the sound buffer between 2/5 and 3/5
	      full. If you crank it up to 4, you  can  definitely  notice  the
	      lag.

   Input options
       -[no]coin_lockout, -[no]coinlock
	      Enables  simulation  of  the  "coin  lockout"  feature  that  is
	      implmeneted on a number of game PCBs. It was up to the  operator
	      whether  or not the coin lockout outputs were actually connected
	      to the  coin  mechanisms.  If  this  feature  is	enabled,  then
	      attempts	to  enter a coin while the lockout is active will fail
	      and will display a popup message in the user interface. If  this
	      feature  is  disabled,  the coin lockout signal will be ignored.
	      The default is ON (-coin_lockout).

       -ctrlr controller
	      Enables support for special controllers. Configuration files are
	      loaded  from  the  ctrlrpath. They are in the same format as the
	      .cfg files that are saved, but only control  configuration  data
	      is read from the file. The default is NULL (no controller file).

       -[no]mouse
	      Controls	whether  or  not  MAME looks for a mouse controller to
	      use. Note that in many cases, lightguns are treated as  mice  by
	      the  operating  system, so you may need to enable this to enable
	      lightgun support. When this is enabled, you will not be able  to
	      use  your mouse while playing a game. If you want to get control
	      of your computer back, you will need to either pause the game or
	      quit. The default is OFF (-nomouse).

       -[no]joystick, -[no]joy
	      Controls	whether  or  not  MAME looks for joystick/gamepad con‐
	      trollers.  The default is ON (-joystick).

       -[no]lightgun, -[no]gun
	      Controls whether or not MAME makes use of lightgun  controllers.
	      Note  that  most	lightguns map to the mouse, so using -lightgun
	      and -mouse together may produce strange results. The default  is
	      OFF (-nolightgun).

       -[no]multikeyboard, -[no]multikey
	      Determines  whether  MAME  differentiates  between multiple key‐
	      boards.  Some systems may report	more  than  one  keyboard;  by
	      default,	the  data  from  all of these keyboards is combined so
	      that it looks like a single keyboard.  Turning  this  option  on
	      will  enable  MAME  to  report keypresses on different keyboards
	      independently. The default is OFF (-nomultikeyboard).

       -[no]multimouse
	      Determines whether MAME differentiates  between  multiple  mice.
	      Some  systems may report more than one mouse device; by default,
	      the data from all of these mice is combined  so  that  it  looks
	      like  a single mouse. Turning this option on will enable MAME to
	      report mouse movement and button presses on different mice inde‐
	      pendently. The default is OFF (-nomultimouse).

       -[no]steadykey, -[no]steady
	      Some  games require two or more buttons to be pressed at exactly
	      the same time to make special moves. Due to limitations  in  the
	      PC  keyboard hardware, it can be difficult or even impossible to
	      accomplish that  using  the  standard  keyboard  handling.  This
	      option selects a different handling that makes it easier to reg‐
	      ister simultaneous button presses, but has the  disadvantage  of
	      making  controls	less  responsive.  The	default  is OFF (-nos‐
	      teadykey).

       -[no]ui_active
	      Enable MAME user interface  on  top  of  emulated  keyboard  (if
	      present).  Default is OFF (-noui_active).

       -[no]offscreen_reload, -[no]reload
	      Controls whether or not MAME treats a second button input from a
	      lightgun as a reload signal. In this case, MAME will report  the
	      gun's position as (0,MAX) with the trigger held, which is equiv‐
	      alent to an offscreen reload. This is only needed for games that
	      required you to shoot offscreen to reload, and then only if your
	      gun does not support off screen  reloads.  The  default  is  OFF
	      (-nooffscreen_reload).

       -joystick_map, -joymap map
	      Controls	how  joystick values map to digital joystick controls.

       -joystick_deadzone, -joy_deadzone, -jdz value
	      If you play with an analog joystick, the center can drift a lit‐
	      tle.  joystick_deadzone tells how far along  an  axis  you  must
	      move  before  the  axis  starts to change. This option expects a
	      float in the range of 0.0 to 1.0. Where 0 is the center  of  the
	      joystick and 1 is the outer limit. The default is 0.3.

       -joystick_saturation, -joy_saturation, -jsat value
	      If  you  play with an analog joystick, the ends can drift a lit‐
	      tle, and may not match in the +/-  directions.  joystick_satura‐
	      tion  tells  how	far  along  an	axis  movement	change will be
	      accepted before  it  reaches  the  maximum  range.  This	option
	      expects  a float in the range of 0.0 to 1.0, where 0 is the cen‐
	      ter of the joystick and 1 is the outer limit.   The  default  is
	      0.85.

       -[no]natural, -[no]nat
	      Allows user to specify whether or not to use a natural keyboard.
	      This allows you to start your game or system in a 'native' mode,
	      depending   on   your   region,	allowing   compatibility   for
	      non-"QWERTY" style keyboards.  The default is OFF (-nonatural).

       -[no]joystick_contradictory, -[no]joy_contradictory
	      Enable contradictory direction digital  joystick	input  at  the
	      same time.  Default is OFF (-nojoystick_contradictory).

       -coin_impulse time
	      Set  coin  impulse  time. A negative value for time disables the
	      impulse; set time to 0 to obey driver or give a  positive  value
	      to set impulse time.

       -uimodekey, -umk value
	      Specifies  the  key  used  to toggle between full and partial UI
	      mode.

	      -keymap_file. Default is OFF (-nokeymap).

       -keymap_file keymap_file
	      Specifies  the  full  path  to the keymap file to be used. A few
	      keymap files are available in /usr/share/games/mess/keymaps.

       -joy_idx[0-8] joystick
	      With these options you can assign a joystick to a specific index
	      in MAME. Even if the kernel will list the joysticks in a differ‐
	      ent order on the next boot, MAME will still see the joystick  as
	      e.g. "Joystick 2". Use mame -v to see which joysticks are recog‐
	      nized.  Default is 'auto'.

       -[no]sixaxis
	      Use special handling for PS3 Sixaxis  controllers.   Default  is
	      OFF (-nosixaxis).

	      Alternative libGL.so to use; 'auto' selects SDL default.

   Input automatic enable options
       -paddle_device, -paddle [none|keyboard|mouse|lightgun|joystick]

       -adstick_device, -adstick [none|keyboard|mouse|lightgun|joystick]

       -dial_device, -dial [none|keyboard|mouse|lightgun|joystick]

       -trackball_device, -trackball [none|keyboard|mouse|lightgun|joystick]

       -lightgun_device [none|keyboard|mouse|lightgun|joystick]

       -positional_device [none|keyboard|mouse|lightgun|joystick]

       -mouse_device [none|keyboard|mouse|lightgun|joystick]
	      Each of these options controls autoenabling the mouse,  or  joy‐
	      stick  depending on the presence of a particular class of analog
	      control for a particular game. For example, if you  specify  the
	      option  -paddle  mouse,  then any game that has a paddle control
	      will automatically enable mouse controls	just  as  if  you  had
	      explicitly  specified -mouse.  Note that these controls override
	      the values of -[no]mouse, -[no]joystick, etc.

   Debugging options
