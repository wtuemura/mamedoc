ROMCMP(1)		   MAME romset checking tool		     ROMCMP(1)

NAME
       romcmp - MAME rom and romsets check and comparison tool

SYNOPSIS
       romcmp [-option] [dir1|zip1] [dir2|zip2]

DESCRIPTION
       romcmp  is  a  tool developed to detect the most common errors that can
       occur when dumping ROMS,  for  example  stuck  bits  and  address  line
       errors.

       It  can	check  the ROMs in ZIP files or subdirectories; it can also be
       used to compare two ROM sets, by giving it two files or	subdirectories
       as parameters. It will determine which ROMS are identical and which are
       the closest matches.  This is useful  when  figuring  out  if  a  newly
       dumped ROM set is a clone of another ROM set.

OPTIONS
       -d     Enables a slower, more comprehensive comparison.

EXAMPLES
       romcmp jumpkids.zip will output the following:

	 11 files
	 23.3c		   FIXED BITS (xxxxxx1x)
	 23.3c		   FIRST AND SECOND HALF IDENTICAL

       This tells us that the 23.3C ROM in Jump Kids is bad, and incidentally,
       it causes the missing sound in that game.
