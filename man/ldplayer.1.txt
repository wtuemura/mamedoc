NAME
       ldplayer - MAME laserdisc image player

SYNOPSIS
       ldplayer pr8210 -rompath /path/to/pr8210.zip\;/path/to/image.chd

DESCRIPTION
       ldplayer  is  an optional utility that simply plays the audio and video
       from laserdisc CHD files. It actually emulates  and  therefore  behaves
       just  like  a  real  laserdisc  player  -  you can pause, fast-forward,
       rewind, and all the rest.

NOTES
       First of all, you need to go to your MAME ROMs folder and make  a  copy
       of cubeqst.zip (the ROMs for Cube Quest). Rename it as pr8210.zip.

       Next, run ldplayer.  Note that the first path in the -rompath option is
       the full path to the pr8210.zip file and the second is the full path to
       the  laserdisc  CHD  file  you wish to play. Note the backslash and the
       semicolon - \; - between them.

       Once ldplayer is running, you can hit TAB  like	usual  and  check  out
       Inputs (this game) to see the controls. Space is the Play/Pause button,
       for instance. Note that some laserdiscs (notably Cube  Quest)  have  30
       seconds	or  more  of  nothing  at  the start, so you either need to be
       patient or use fast-forward to start seeing video.
