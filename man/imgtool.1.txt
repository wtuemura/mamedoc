DESCRIPTION
       imgtool is a tool for the maintenance  and  manipulation  of  disk  and
       other  types  of  images  that  MESS users need to deal with. Functions
       include retrieving and storing files and CRC checking  and  validation.
       Image files can also be within .zip files.

       get    Gets  a  single file from an image. A filter can be specified to
