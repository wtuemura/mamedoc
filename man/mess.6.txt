NAME
       MESS - Multi Emulator Super System

SYNOPSIS
       mess system [media software] [options]

DESCRIPTION
       MESS documents the hardware for a wide variety of (mostly vintage) com‐
       puters, video game consoles, and calculators  through  software	emula‐
       tion.  As  a nice side effect, MESS allows software and games for these
       hardware platforms to run on modern PCs.

SOFTWARE
       A software entry may be specified to attach an image file to  the  emu‐
       lated  system.  In  such  a  case, the appropriate media switch is also
       required:

       -cart, -cart1
	      Cartrigde, used mainly by game consoles

       -cass  Cassette (tape), widely used by old home computers

       -flop, -flop1
	      Floppy disk

       -cdrom CD-Rom

OPTIONS
   Core commands
       -help, -?
	      Displays current MESS version and copyright notice.

       -validate, -valid
	      Performs internal validation on every driver in MESS.  Run  this
	      before  submitting  changes  to ensure that you haven't violated
	      any of the core system rules.

   Configuration commands
       -createconfig, -cc
	      Creates the default mess.ini file in the current directory.  All
	      the  configuration options (not commands) described below can be
	      permanently changed by editing this configuration file.

       -showconfig, -sc
	      Displays the current configuration settings.

       -showusage, -su
	      Displays a summary of all the command line options. For  options
	      that  are  not  mentioned  here,	the  short  summary  given  by
	      -showusage is usually sufficient.

   Frontend commands
       All the list commands below write info to the screen.  If you  wish  to
       write  the  info  to a textfile instead, use redirection.  For example,
       mess -listxml > ~/messlist.xml writes the full list of  supported  sys‐
       tems to messlist.xml in your home directory.

       -listxml, -lx [system|wildcard]
	      List comprehensive details for all of the supported systems. The
	      output is quite long, so it is usually better to	redirect  this
	      into  a  file.  The output is in XML format. By default all sys‐
	      tems are listed; however, you can limit this list by  specifying
	      a driver name or wildcard.

       -listfull, -ll [system|wildcard]
	      Displays	a  list  of  system  driver names and descriptions. By
	      default all systems are listed; however, you can limit this list
	      by specifying a driver name or wildcard.

       -listsource, -ls [system|wildcard]
	      Displays	a  list  of  drivers and the names of the source files
	      their system drivers live in. Useful for finding which driver  a
	      system  runs on in order to fix bugs. By default all systems are
	      listed; however, you can limit this list by specifying a	driver
	      name or wildcard.

       -listclones, -lc [system|wildcard]
	      Displays	a  list  of  clones. By default all clones are listed;
	      however, you can limit this list by specifying a driver name  or
	      wildcard.

       -listbrothers, -lb [system|wildcard]
	      Displays a list of "brothers" or other drivers from same source‐
	      file.  By default all systems are listed; however, you can limit
	      this list by specifying a driver name or wildcard.

       -listcrc
	      Displays a full list of CRCs of all ROM images referenced by all
	      drivers within MESS code.

       -listroms, -lr system
	      Displays a list of ROM images referenced by the  specified  sys‐
	      tem.

       -listsamples system
	      Displays a list of samples referenced by the specified system.

       -verifyroms [system|wildcard]
	      Checks for invalid or missing ROM images. By default all drivers
	      that have valid ZIP files or directories in  the	rom  path  are
	      verified;  however,  you	can  limit  this  list by specifying a
	      driver name or wildcard.

       -verifysamples [system|wildcard]
	      Checks for invalid or missing samples. By  default  all  drivers
	      that  have  valid ZIP files or directories in the samplepath are
	      verified; however, you can  limit  this  list  by  specifying  a
	      driver name or wildcard.

       -romident
	      Attempts	to  identify  ROM files, if they are known to MESS, in
	      the specified .zip file or directory. This command can  be  used
	      to try and identify ROM sets taken from unknown boards. On exit,
	      the errorlevel is returned as one of the following:
	      0  all files were identified
	      7  all files were identified except for some "non-ROM" files
	      8  some files were identified
	      9  no files were identified

       -listdevices, -ld
	      Output the list of devices referenced by a given system  or  set
	      of systems.

       -listslots, -lslot
	      Output the list of available slots and slot devices for the sys‐
	      tem.

       -listmedia, -lm
	      Output the list of available media for the system.

       -listsoftware, -lsoft
	      Output the list of known software for the system.

       -verifysoftware, -vsoft [gamename|wildcard]
	      Checks for invalid or missing ROM images in your software lists.
	      By  default all drivers that have valid ZIP files or directories
	      in the rompath are verified; however, you can limit this list by
	      specifying a specific driver name or wildcard.

       -getsoftlist, -glist
	      Retrieve software list by name.

       -verifysoftlist, -vlist [softwarelistname]
	      Checks a specified software list for missing ROM images if files
	      exist for issued softwarelistname. By default, all drivers  that
	      have valid ZIP files or directories in the rompath are verified;
	      however, you can limit this list by specifying a specific  soft‐
	      warelistname (without .XML).

       -listmidi, -mlist
	      List available MIDI I/O devices.

       -listnetwork, -nlist
	      List available network adapters.

   Configuration options
       -[no]readconfig, -[no]rc
	      Enables  or  disables  the  reading  of  the  config files. When
	      enabled (which is the default), MESS reads the following	config
	      files in order:
	      1. mess.ini
	      the main configuration file
	      2. [driver].ini
	      based on the source file name of the system driver
	      3. [parent].ini
	      for clones only, may be called recursively
	      4. [system].ini
	      note this sometimes resolves to the same of the source driver

       The  settings  in  the later ini's override those in the earlier ini's.
       The default is ON (-readconfig).

       -[no]writeconfig, -[no]wc
	      Write configuration to [driver].ini on  exit.   Default  is  OFF
	      (-nowriteconfig).

   Search path options
       Be  careful  to	use  the  path, directory and file options in mess.ini
       ONLY. Otherwise, the outcome may be unpredictable  and  not  consistent
       across releases.

       -rompath, -rp, -biospath, -bp pathname
	      Specifies  a list of paths within which to find ROM or hard disk
	      images.  Multiple paths can be specified by separating them with
	      semicolons.   The default is 'roms' (that is, a directory 'roms'
	      in the same directory as the MESS executable).

       -hashpath pathname
	      Specifies a list of paths within which to  search  for  software
	      hash  files.  Multiple paths can be specified by separating them
	      with semicolons.	The default is 'hash' (that  is,  a  directory
	      'hash' in the same directory as the MESS executable).

       -samplepath, -sp pathname
	      Specifies  a  list  of  paths within which to find sample files.
	      Multiple paths can be specified by separating  them  with  semi‐
	      colons. The default is 'samples' (that is, a directory 'samples'
	      in the same directory as the MESS executable).

       -artpath, -artwork_directory pathname
	      Specifies a list of paths within which to  find  artwork	files.
	      Multiple	paths  can  be specified by separating them with semi‐
	      colons. The default is 'artwork' (that is, a directory 'artwork'
	      in the same directory as the MESS executable).

       -ctrlrpath, -ctrlr_directory pathname
	      Specifies  a  list of paths within which to find controller-spe‐
	      cific configuration files. Multiple paths can  be  specified  by
	      separating  them	with  semicolons. The default is 'ctrlr' (that
	      is, a directory 'ctrlr' in the same directory as the  MESS  exe‐
	      cutable).

       -inipath pathname
	      Specifies  a list of paths within which to find .ini files. Mul‐
	      tiple paths can be specified by separating them with semicolons.
	      The default is '/etc/mess'.

       -fontpath pathname
	      Specifies  a list of paths within which to find .bdf font files.
	      Multiple paths can be specified by separating  them  with  semi‐
	      colons.  The  default is '.' (that is, search in the same direc‐
	      tory as the MESS executable).

       -cheatpath pathname
	      Specifies a list of paths within which to find cheat files. Mul‐
	      tiple paths can be specified by separating them with semicolons.
	      The default is 'cheat' (that is, a directory 'cheat' in the same
	      directory as the MESS executable).

       -crosshairpath pathname
	      Specifies  a list of paths within which to find crosshair files.
	      Multiple paths can be specified by separating  them  with  semi‐
	      colons.  The  default  is  'crosshair'  (that  is,  a  directory
	      'crosshair' in the same directory as the MESS  executable).   If
	      the  Crosshair is set to default in the menu, MESS will look for
	      system/cross#.png and then cross#.png  in  the  specified  path,
	      where  #	is  the  player  number.   Failing that, MESS will use
	      built-in default crosshairs.

   Output Directory Options
       -cfg_directory pathname
	      Specifies a  single  directory  where  configuration  files  are
	      stored.	Configuration  files  store user configurable settings
	      that are read at	startup  and  written  when  MESS  exits.  The
	      default  is 'cfg' (that is, a directory 'cfg' in the same direc‐
	      tory as the MESS executable). If this directory does not	exist,
	      it will be automatically created.

       -nvram_directory pathname
	      Specifies a single directory where NVRAM files are stored. NVRAM
	      files store the contents of EEPROM and non-volatile RAM  (NVRAM)
	      for  systems which used this type of hardware. This data is read
	      at startup and written when MESS exits. The default  is  'nvram'
	      (that  is, a directory 'nvram' in the same directory as the MESS
	      executable). If this directory does not exist, it will be  auto‐
	      matically created.

       -input_directory pathname
	      Specifies  a  single  directory  where input recording files are
	      stored.  Input recordings are created via the -record option and
	      played back via the -playback option. The default is 'inp' (that
	      is, a directory 'inp' in the same directory  as  the  MESS  exe‐
	      cutable). If this directory does not exist, it will be automati‐
	      cally created.

       -state_directory pathname
	      Specifies a single directory where save state files are  stored.
	      Save  state files are read and written either upon user request,
	      or when using the -autosave option. The default is  'sta'  (that
	      is,  a  directory  'sta'	in the same directory as the MESS exe‐
	      cutable). If this directory does not exist, it will be automati‐
	      cally created.

       -snapshot_directory pathname
	      Specifies  a single directory where screen snapshots are stored,
	      when requested by the user. The default is 'snap'  (that	is,  a
	      directory  'snap' in the same directory as the MESS executable).
	      If this directory does not exist, it will be automatically  cre‐
	      ated.

       -diff_directory pathname
	      Specifies a single directory where hard drive differencing files
	      are stored. Hard drive differencing files store any data that is
	      written  back  to  a  hard  disk image, in order to preserve the
	      original image. The differencing files are  created  at  startup
	      when  a  system  with  a	hard disk image. The default is 'diff'
	      (that is, a directory 'diff' in the same directory as  the  MESS
	      executable).  If this directory does not exist, it will be auto‐
	      matically created.

       -comment_directory pathname
	      Specifies a single directory where debugger  comment  files  are
	      stored.  Debugger comment files are written by the debugger when
	      comments are added to the disassembly for a system. The  default
	      is  'comments'  (that  is,  a  directory	'comments' in the same
	      directory as the MESS executable).  If this directory  does  not
	      exist, it will be automatically created.

   State/playback options
       -state slot
	      Immediately  after starting the specified system, will cause the
	      save state in the specified slot to be loaded.

       -[no]autosave
	      When enabled, automatically creates a save state file when exit‐
	      ing  MESS  and  automatically  attempts  to reload it when later
	      starting MESS with the same system. This only works for  systems
	      that have explicitly enabled save state support in their driver.
	      The default is OFF (-noautosave).

       -playback, -pb filename
	      Specifies a file from which to play  back  a  series  of	system
	      inputs. This feature does not work reliably for all systems, but
	      can be used to watch a previously recorded system  session  from
	      start  to finish. In order to make things consistent, you should
	      only record and playback with all  configuration	(.cfg),  NVRAM
	      (.nv),  and  memory  card files deleted. The default is NULL (no
	      playback).

       -[no]exit_after_playback
	      If play back is enabled (see -playback option) the program exits
	      when end of file is reached. Otherwise the machine will continue
	      to run.  Default is OFF (-noexit_after_playback).

       -record, -rec filename
	      Specifies a file to record all input from a system session. This
	      can  be used to record a system session for later playback. This
	      feature does not work reliably for all systems, but can be  used
	      to watch a previously recorded system session from start to fin‐
	      ish. In order to make things consistent, you should only	record
	      and  playback  with  all	configuration (.cfg), NVRAM (.nv), and
	      memory card files deleted. The default is NULL (no recording).

       -[no]record_timecode
	      Specify whether to create a timecode file. It  contains  a  line
	      with  elapsed  times  on	each  press  of  timecode shortcut key
	      (default is F12).  This option works only when recording mode is
	      enabled  (-record  option).   The  file  is saved on inp folder.
	      Default is OFF (-norecord_timecode).

       -mngwrite filename
	      Writes each video frame to the given file in MNG format, produc‐
	      ing  an  animation  of  the system session.  Note that -mngwrite
	      only writes video frames; it does not save any audio  data.  Use
	      -wavwrite for that, and reassemble the audio/video using offline
	      tools. The default is NULL (no recording).

       -aviwrite filename
	      Stream video and sound data to the given	file  in  AVI  format,
	      producing  an  animation	of  the  system  session complete with
	      sound. The default is NULL (no recording).

       -wavwrite filename
	      Writes the final mixer output to the given file in  WAV  format,
	      producing an audio recording of the system session.  The default
	      is NULL (no recording).

       -snapname string
	      Describes how MESS should name files for snapshots. string  pro‐
	      vides a template that is used to generate a filename. Three sim‐
	      ple substitutions are provided: the / character  represents  the
	      path  separator  on any target platform (even Windows); the lit‐
	      eral %g represents the driver name of the  current  system;  and
	      the  literal %i represents an incrementing index. If %i is omit‐
	      ted, then each snapshot taken will overwrite the	previous  one;
	      otherwise,  MESS	will  find the next empty value for %i and use
	      that for a filename. The default is  '%g/%i',  which  creates  a
	      separate	folder for each game, and names the snapshots under it
	      starting with 0000 and increasing from there. In addition to the
	      above,  for  drivers using different media, like carts or floppy
	      disks, you  can  also  use  the  %d_[media]  indicator.  Replace
	      [media]  with  the media switch you want to use. A few examples:
	      if you use mess nes -cart robby -snapname  %g/%d_cart  snapshots
	      will be saved as snaps/nes/robby.png; if you use mess c64 -flop1
	      robby  -snapname	%g/%d_flop1/%i	snapshots  will  be  saved  as
	      snaps/c64/robby/0000.png.

       -snapsize widthxheight
	      Hard-codes  the  size  for  snapshots  and  movie  recording. By
	      default, MESS will create snapshots at the system's current res‐
	      olution  in  raw	pixels, and will create movies at the system's
	      starting resolution in raw pixels. If you specify  this  option,
	      then  MESS  will	create	both  snapshots and movies at the size
	      specified, and will bilinear filter the result. Note  that  this
	      size  does  not automatically rotate if the system is vertically
	      oriented. The default is 'auto'.

       -snapview internal|auto|viewname
	      Specifies the view to use when rendering snapshots  and  movies.
	      By  default, both use a special 'internal' view, which renders a
	      separate snapshot per screen or renders movies only of the first
	      screen. By specifying this option, you can override this default
	      behavior and select a single view that will apply to  all  snap‐
	      shots and movies.  Note that viewname does not need to be a per‐
	      fect match; rather, it will select the  first  view  whose  name
	      matches  all  the characters specified by viewname. For example,
	      -snapview native will  match  the  "Native  (15:14)"  view  even
	      though  it is not a perfect match.  viewname can also be 'auto',
	      which selects the first  view  with  all	screens  present.  The
	      default value is 'internal'.

       -[no]snapbilinear
	      Specify  whether	snapshot/movie	should have bilinear filtering
	      applied.	Default is ON (-snapbilinear).

       -statename string
	      Describes how MESS should store save state  files,  relative  to
	      the  state_directory  path.  string  provides a template that is
	      used to generate a relative path. Two simple  substitutions  are
	      provided:  the  / character represents the path separator on any
	      target platform (even Windows); the literal  %g  represents  the
	      driver name of the current game. The default is '%g', which cre‐
	      ates a separate folder for each game. In addition to the	above,
	      for  drivers  using different media, like carts or floppy disks,
	      you can also use the %d_[media] indicator. Replace [media]  with
	      the  media  switch  you  want to use. A few examples: if you use
	      mess nes -cart robby -statename %g/%d_cart save states  will  be
	      stored  inside  sta/nes/robby/; if you use mess c64 -flop1 robby
	      -statename  %g/%d_flop1  save  states  will  be  stored	inside
	      sta/c64/robby/.

       -[no]burnin
	      Tracks  brightness  of  the screen during play and at the end of
	      emulation generates a PNG that can be used to  simulate  burn-in
	      effects on other systems. The resulting PNG is created such that
	      the least-used areas  of	the  screen  are  fully  white	(since
	      burned-in  areas	are darker, all other areas of the screen must
	      be lightened a touch).  The intention is that this  PNG  can  be
	      loaded  via an artwork file with a low alpha (e.g, 0.1-0.2 seems
	      to work well) and blended over the entire screen. The PNG  files
	      are    saved    in   the	 snap	directory   under   the   sys‐
	      tem/burnin-<screen.name>.png. The default is OFF (-noburnin).

   Performance options
       -[no]autoframeskip, -[no]afs
	      Automatically determines the frameskip level while you're  play‐
	      ing  the system, adjusting it constantly in a frantic attempt to
	      keep the system running at full speed. Turning this on overrides
	      the  value you have set for -frameskip below. The default is OFF
	      (-noautoframeskip).

       -frameskip, -fs value
	      Specifies the frameskip value (autoframeskip must be  disabled).
	      This  is	the number of frames out of every 12 to drop when run‐
	      ning. For example, if you say -frameskip 2, then MESS will  dis‐
	      play  10	out  of every 12 frames. By skipping those frames, you
	      may be able to get full speed in a  system  that	requires  more
	      horsepower than your computer has. The default value is 0, which
	      skips no frames.

       -seconds_to_run, -str value
	      This option can be used for benchmarking and automated  testing.
	      It tells MESS to stop execution after a fixed number of seconds.
	      By combining this  with  a  fixed  set  of  other  command  line
	      options,	you can set up a consistent environment for benchmark‐
	      ing MESS performance. In addition, upon exit,  the  -str	option
	      will  write  a screenshot called final.png to the system's snap‐
	      shot directory.

       -[no]throttle
	      Configures the default thottling setting. When throttling is on,
	      MESS  attempts  to  keep	the  system  running  at  the system's
	      intended speed. When throttling is off, MESS runs the system  as
	      fast  as	it can. Note that the fastest speed is more often than
	      not limited by your graphics card, especially for older systems.
	      The default is ON (-throttle).

       -[no]sleep
	      Allows  MESS  to	give time back to the system when running with
	      -throttle.  This allows other programs to have  some  CPU  time,
	      assuming	 that  the  system  isn't  taxing  100%  of  your  CPU
	      resources. This option can potentially cause hiccups in  perfor‐
	      mance  if  other demanding programs are running.	The default is
	      ON (-sleep).

       -speed value
	      Controls the speed of gameplay, relative	to  realtime;  smaller
	      numbers are slower. Default is 1.00.

       -[no]refreshspeed, -[no]rs
	      Automatically adjusts the -speed parameter to keep the effective
	      refresh rate below that  of  the	lowest	screen	refresh  rate.
	      Default is OFF (-norefreshspeed).

       -[no]multithreading, -[no]mt
	      Enable  multithreading; this enables rendering and blitting on a
	      separate thread. The default is OFF (-nomultithreading).

       -numprocessors, -np value
	      Set number of processors; this overrides the number  the	system
	      reports.

       -bench value
	      Benchmark  for  the  given  number  of emulated seconds; implies
	      -video none -sound none -nothrottle.

       -[no]sdlvideofps
	      Show SDL video performance. Default is OFF (-nosdlvideofps).

   Rotation options
       -[no]rotate
	      Rotate the system to match its normal  state  (horizontal/verti‐
	      cal).  This  ensures  that both vertically and horizontally ori‐
	      ented systems show up correctly without the need to rotate  your
	      monitor.	If you want to keep the system displaying 'raw' on the
	      screen the way the actual machine would have, turn  this	option
	      off. The default is ON (-rotate).

       -[no]ror -[no]rol
	      Rotate  the  system  screen  to  the  right  (clockwise) or left
	      (counter-clockwise) relative to  either  its  normal  state  (if
	      -rotate is specified) or its native state (if -norotate is spec‐
	      ified).  Default for both is OFF (-noror -norol).

       -[no]autoror -[no]autorol
	      These options are designed for use with  pivoting  screens  that
	      only  pivot  in  a  single direction. If your screen only pivots
	      clockwise, use -autorol to ensure that the system will fill  the
	      screen  either  horizontally  or vertically in one of the direc‐
	      tions you can handle.  If your screen only pivots counter-clock‐
	      wise,  use -autoror.  Default for both is OFF (-noautoror -noau‐
	      torol).

       -[no]flipx -[no]flipy
	      Flip (mirror) the system screen either horizontally (-flipx)  or
	      vertically (-flipy). The flips are applied after the -rotate and
	      -ror/-rol  options  are  applied.   Default  for	both  is   OFF
	      (-noflipx -noflipy).

   Artwork options
       -[no]artwork_crop, -[no]artcrop
	      Enable  cropping of artwork to the system screen area only. This
	      option can also be controlled via the Video Options menu in  the
	      user interface. The default is OFF (-noartwork_crop).

       -[no]use_backdrops, -[no]backdrop
	      Enables/disables	the  display  of  backdrops. The default is ON
	      (-use_backdrops).

       -[no]use_overlays, -[no]overlay
	      Enables/disables the display of  overlays.  The  default	is  ON
	      (-use_overlays).

       -[no]use_bezels, -[no]bezel
	      Enables/disables	the  display  of  bezels.  The	default  is ON
	      (-use_bezels).

       -[no]use_cpanels, -[no]cpanel
	      Enables/disables the display  of	cpanels.  The  default	is  ON
	      (-use_bezels).

       -[no]use_marquees, -[no]marquee
	      Enables/disables	the  display  of  marquees.  The default is ON
	      (-use_bezels).

   Screen options
       -brightness value
	      Controls the default brightness, or black level, of  the	system
	      screens.	This option does not affect the artwork or other parts
	      of the display.  Using the MESS UI, you can individually set the
	      brightness for each system screen; this option controls the ini‐
	      tial value for all visible system screens. The standard value is
	      1.0.  Selecting  lower values (down to 0.1) will produce a dark‐
	      ened display, while selecting higher values  (up	to  2.0)  will
	      give a brighter display. The default is 1.0.

       -contrast value
	      Controls	the  contrast,	or white level, of the system screens.
	      This option does not affect the artwork or other	parts  of  the
	      display.	Using  the  MESS UI, you can individually set the con‐
	      trast for each system screen; this option controls  the  initial
	      value for all visible system screens. The standard value is 1.0.
	      Selecting lower values (down to 0.1) will produce a dimmer  dis‐
	      play, while selecting higher values (up to 2.0) will give a more
	      saturated display. The default is 1.0.

       -gamma value
	      Controls the gamma, which produces a potentially nonlinear black
	      to  white  ramp,	for  the  system screens. This option does not
	      affect the artwork or other parts of the display. Using the MESS
	      UI,  you	can individually set the gamma for each system screen;
	      this option controls the initial value for  all  visible	system
	      screens.	The  standard  value is 1.0, which gives a linear ramp
	      from black to white. Selecting lower values (down to  0.1)  will
	      increase	the  nonlinearity toward black, while selecting higher
	      values (up to 3.0) will push the nonlinearity toward white.  The
	      default is 1.0.

       -pause_brightness value
	      This  controls  the  brightness  level  when MESS is paused. The
	      default value is 0.65.

       -effect [none|filename[.png]]
	      Name of a PNG file to use for visual effects, or 'none'. Default
	      is 'none'.

   Vector rendering options
       -[no]antialias, -[no]aa
	      Enables  antialiased  line  rendering  for  vector  systems. The
	      default is ON (-antialias).

       -beam value
	      Sets the width of the vectors. This is a scaling factor  against
	      the  standard vector width. A value of 1.0 will keep the default
	      vector line width. Smaller values will  reduce  the  width,  and
	      larger values will increase the width. The default is 1.0.

       -flicker value
	      Simulates a vector "flicker" effect, similar to a vector monitor
	      that needs adjustment. This option requires a float argument  in
	      the  range  of 0.00-100.00 (0=none, 100=maximum). The default is
	      0.

   Video options
       -video [soft|opengl|none]
	      Specifies which video subsystem to use for drawing:
	      soft  uses software rendering, which is slower but more compati‐
	      ble.
	      opengl   uses  OpenGL  and your graphics accelerator to speed up
	      many aspects of  drawing	MESS  including  compositing  artwork,
	      overlays,  and  bezels,  as  well as stretching the image to fit
	      your screen.
	      none  does no drawing and is intended for CPU benchmarking.
	      Default is SOFT.

       -[no]window, -[no]w
	      Run MESS in either full screen or a window. This is a fully-fea‐
	      tured window mode where the window resizes as necessary to track
	      what the system does.  And you can resize it yourself with  your
	      OS's standard window controls.  The default is OFF (-nowindow).

       -[no]maximize, -[no]max
	      Controls	initial window size in windowed mode. If it is set on,
	      the window will initially be set to the maximum  supported  size
	      when  you start MESS. If it is turned off, the window will start
	      out at the smallest supported size.  This  option  only  has  an
	      effect when the -window option is used. The default is ON (-max‐
	      imize).

       -[no]keepaspect, -[no]ka
	      Forces the correct aspect ratio. This means when you're resizing
	      the  window in windowed mode the actual system image will resize
	      in discrete steps to maintain the proper	shape  of  the	system
	      graphics. If you turn this off you can resize the window to any‐
	      thing you like and get funny squishing and stretching.  The same
	      applies for full-screen. Default is ON (-keepaspect).

       -[no]unevenstretch, -[no]ues
	      Allow  non-integer  stretch  factors.  Video purists should stay
	      far, far away from this option,  while  everyone	else  will  be
	      happy  to  know  that  it  lets  you fill the screen properly in
	      full-screen mode. Default is ON (-unevenstretch).

       -[no]centerh
	      Center horizontally within the view area. Default is  ON	(-cen‐
	      terh).

       -[no]centerv
	      Center  vertically  within  the  view area. Default is ON (-cen‐
	      terv).

       -[no]waitvsync, -[no]vs
	      Enable waiting for the start of VBLANK before flipping  screens;
	      reduces tearing effects. Default is OFF (-nowaitvsync).

       -[no]syncrefresh, -[no]srf
	      Enable  using  the start of VBLANK for throttling instead of the
	      game time.  Default is OFF (-nosyncrefresh).

   Software video rendering subsystem options
       All the options in this group are available  only  with	softare  video
       rendering subsystem (-video soft).

       -prescale [value]
	      Scale screen rendering by this amount in software. Default is 1.

       -scalemode, -sm [none|async|yv12|yuy2|yv12x2|yuy2x2]
	      Hardware scaling mode.
	      none    use software rendering.
	      async   async overlay.
	      yv12    yv12 overlay.
	      yuy2    yuy2 overlay.
	      yv12x2  yv12 overlay using x2 prescaling.
	      yuy2x2  yuy2 overlay using x2 prescaling.
	      Default is NONE.

   OpenGL video rendering subsystem options
       All the options in this group are available only with OpenGL video ren‐
       dering subsystem (-video opengl or -video opengl16).

       -[no]filter, -[no]glfilter, -[no]flt
	      Enable bilinear filtering on screen output. Default is ON (-fil‐
	      ter).

       -[no]gl_forcepow2texture
	      Force power of two textures. Default is OFF (-nogl_forcepow2tex‐
	      ture).

       -[no]gl_notexturerect
	      Don't use OpenGL GL_ARB_texture_rectangle. Turn off  if  corrup‐
	      tion  occurs  in	OpenGL mode, at cost of some performance loss.
	      Default is ON (-gl_notexturerect).

       -[no]gl_vbo
	      Enable OpenGL VBO, if available,	for  a	performance  increase.
	      Turn off if corruption occurs. Default is ON (-gl_vbo).

       -[no]gl_pbo
	      Enable  OpenGL  PBO,  if	available, for a performance increase.
	      Turn off if corruption occurs. Default is ON (-gl_pbo).

       -[no]gl_glsl
	      Enable OpenGL GLSL, if available, for  a	performance  increase.
	      Default is OFF (-nogl_glsl).

       -gl_glsl_filter value
	      Enable  OpenGL  GLSL  filtering instead of FF filtering 0=plain,
	      1=bilinear.  Default is 1: bilinear.

       -glsl_shader_mame[0-9]
	      Preferred custom OpenGL GLSL shader set mame bitmap (from  0  to
	      9).

       -glsl_shader_screen[0-9]
	      Preferred custom OpenGL GLSL shader screen bitmap (from 0 to 9).

       -gl_glsl_vid_attr
	      Enable  OpenGL  GLSL handling of brightness and contrast. Better
	      RGB system performance for free. Default is ON.

       -screen
	      Explicit name for all screens; 'auto' here will try  to  make  a
	      best guess.

       -aspect, -screen_aspect
	      Aspect  ratio  for  all  screens; 'auto' here will try to make a
	      best guess.

       -resolution, -r
	      Preferred  resolution  for  all  screens;  format   is   widthx‐
	      height[@refreshrate] or 'auto'.

       -view  Preferred view for all screens

       -screen[0-3]
	      Explicit	name  of  the first|second|third|fourth screen; 'auto'
	      here will try to make a best guess.

       -aspect[0-3]
	      Aspect ratio of  the  first|second|third|fourth  screen;	'auto'
	      here will try to make a best guess.

       -resolution[0-3], -r[0-3]
	      Preferred  resolution  for the first|second|third|fourth screen;
	      format is widthxheight[@refreshrate] or 'auto'.

       -view[0-3]
	      Preferred view for the first|second|third|fourth screen.

   Full screen options
       -[no]switchres
	      Affects full screen mode only. Chooses if MESS can try to change
	      the  screen resolution (color depth is normally left alone) when
	      in full-screen mode. If it's off, you always  get  your  desktop
	      resolution  in  full-screen mode (which can be useful for LCDs).
	      Default is OFF (-noswitchres).

       -[no]useallheads
	      Split full screen image across monitors. Default is OFF (-nouse‐
	      allhead).

   Sound options
       -[no]sound
	      Enable or disable sound altogether. The default is ON (-sound).

       -samplerate, -sr value
	      Sets  the  audio	sample rate. Smaller values (e.g. 11025) cause
	      lower audio quality but faster emulation	speed.	Higher	values
	      (e.g.  48000)  cause  higher  audio quality but slower emulation
	      speed. The default is 48000.

       -[no]samples
	      Use samples if available. The default is ON (-samples).

       -volume, -vol value
	      Sets the startup volume. It can later be changed with  the  user
	      interface  (see  Keys  section). The volume is an attenuation in
	      dB: for example, '-volume -12' will start  with  -12dB  attenua‐
	      tion.  The default is 0.

       -audio_latency value
	      This controls the amount of latency built into the audio stream‐
	      ing.  The latency parameter controls the	lower  threshold.  The
	      default  is 3; increase to reduce glitches, decrease for respon‐
	      siveness.

   Input options
       -[no]coin_lockout, -[no]coinlock
	      Enables simulation of the "coin lockout" feature that is	imple‐
	      mented  on a number of arcade game PCBs. It was up to the opera‐
	      tor whether or not the coin lockout outputs were	actually  con‐
	      nected  to the coin mechanisms. If this feature is enabled, then
	      attempts to enter a coin while the lockout is active  will  fail
	      and  will display a popup message in the user interface. If this
	      feature is disabled, the coin lockout signal  will  be  ignored.
	      The default is ON (-coin_lockout).

       -ctrlr controller
	      Enables support for special controllers. Configuration files are
	      loaded from the ctrlrpath. They are in the same  format  as  the
	      .cfg  files  that are saved, but only control configuration data
	      is read from the file. The default is NULL (no controller file).

       -[no]mouse
	      Controls whether or not MESS looks for  a  mouse	controller  to
	      use.  Note  that in many cases, lightguns are treated as mice by
	      the operating system, so you may need to enable this  to	enable
	      lightgun	support. When this is enabled, you will not be able to
	      use your mouse while running MESS. If you want to get control of
	      your  computer back, you will need to either pause MESS or quit.
	      The default is OFF (-nomouse).

       -[no]joystick, -[no]joy
	      Controls whether or not MESS  looks  for	joystick/gamepad  con‐
	      trollers.  The default is ON (-joystick).

       -[no]lightgun, -[no]gun
	      Controls	whether or not MESS makes use of lightgun controllers.
	      Note that most lightguns map to the mouse,  so  using  -lightgun
	      and  -mouse together may produce strange results. The default is
	      OFF (-nolightgun).

       -[no]multikeyboard, -[no]multikey
	      Determines whether MESS  differentiates  between	multiple  key‐
	      boards.	Some  systems  may  report  more than one keyboard; by
	      default, the data from all of these  keyboards  is  combined  so
	      that  it	looks  like  a single keyboard. Turning this option on
	      will enable MESS to report  keypresses  on  different  keyboards
	      independently. The default is OFF (-nomultikeyboard).

       -[no]multimouse
	      Determines  whether  MESS  differentiates between multiple mice.
	      Some systems may report more than one mouse device; by  default,
	      the  data  from  all  of these mice is combined so that it looks
	      like a single mouse. Turning this option on will enable MESS  to
	      report mouse movement and button presses on different mice inde‐
	      pendently. The default is OFF (-nomultimouse).

       -[no]steadykey, -[no]steady
	      Some systems require two	or  more  buttons  to  be  pressed  at
	      exactly  the same time to make special moves. Due to limitations
	      in the PC keyboard hardware, it can be difficult or even	impos‐
	      sible  to  accomplish that using the standard keyboard handling.
	      This option selects a different handling that makes it easier to
	      register	simultaneous  button presses, but has the disadvantage
	      of making controls less responsive. The default  is  OFF	(-nos‐
	      teadykey).

       -[no]ui_active
	      Enable  MESS  user  interface  on  top  of emulated keyboard (if
	      present).  User interface may be	toggled  during  execution  by
	      pressing	the  key  defined  with  -ui_modekey.	Default is OFF
	      (-noui_active).

       -[no]offscreen_reload, -[no]reload
	      Controls whether or not MESS treats a second button input from a
	      lightgun	as a reload signal. In this case, MESS will report the
	      gun's position as (0,MAX) with the trigger held, which is equiv‐
	      alent  to  an  offscreen reload. This is only needed for systems
	      that required you to shoot offscreen to reload, and then only if
	      your gun does not support off screen reloads. The default is OFF
	      (-nooffscreen_reload).

       -joystick_map, -joymap map
	      Controls how joystick values map to digital  joystick  controls.
	      See  /usr/share/doc/mame-common/config.txt  for  full details on
	      joymap format.

       -joystick_deadzone, -joy_deadzone, -jdz value
	      If you play with an analog joystick, the center can drift a lit‐
	      tle.   joystick_deadzone	tells  how  far along an axis you must
	      move before the axis starts to change.  This  option  expects  a
	      float  in  the range of 0.0 to 1.0. Where 0 is the center of the
	      joystick and 1 is the outer limit. The default is 0.3.

       -joystick_saturation, -joy_saturation, -jsat value
	      If you play with an analog joystick, the ends can drift  a  lit‐
	      tle,  and  may not match in the +/- directions. joystick_satura‐
	      tion tells how  far  along  an  axis  movement  change  will  be
	      accepted	before	it  reaches  the  maximum  range.  This option
	      expects a float in the range of 0.0 to 1.0, where 0 is the  cen‐
	      ter  of  the  joystick and 1 is the outer limit.	The default is
	      0.85.

       -[no]natural, -[no]nat
	      Allows user to specify whether or not to use a natural keyboard.
	      This allows you to start your game or system in a 'native' mode,
	      depending   on   your   region,	allowing   compatibility   for
	      non-"QWERTY" style keyboards.  The default is OFF (-nonatural).

       -[no]joystick_contradictory, -[no]joy_contradictory
	      Enable  contradictory  direction	digital  joystick input at the
	      same time.  Default is OFF (-nojoystick_contradictory).

       -uimodekey, -umk
	      Specifies the key used to toggle between	full  and  partial  UI
	      mode.

       -[no]keymap
	      Enable keymap for non-QWERTY keyboards. Used in conjunction with
	      -keymap_file. Default is OFF (-nokeymap).

       -keymap_file keymap_file
	      Specifies the full path to the keymap file to  be  used.	A  few
	      keymap files are available in /usr/share/games/mess/keymaps.

       -joy_idx[0-8] joystick
	      With these options you can assign a joystick to a specific index
	      in MESS. Even if the kernel will list the joysticks in a differ‐
	      ent  order on the next boot, MESS will still see the joystick as
	      e.g. "Joystick 2". Use mame -v to see which joysticks are recog‐
	      nized.  Default is 'auto'.

       -[no]sixaxis
	      Use  special  handling  for PS3 Sixaxis controllers.  Default is
	      OFF (-nosixaxis).

       -lightgun_index[1-8]
	      Map lightgun to specific index in MESS.

       -videodriver, -vd x11|directfb|auto
	      SDL video driver to use; auto selects SDL default.

       -audiodriver, -ad alsa|arts|auto
	      SDL audio driver to use; auto selects SDL default.

       -gl_lib alsa|arts|auto
	      Alternative libGL.so to use; auto selects SDL default.

   Input automatic enable options
       -paddle_device, -paddle [none|keyboard|mouse|lightgun|joystick]

       -adstick_device, -adstick [none|keyboard|mouse|lightgun|joystick]

       -pedal_device, -pedal [none|keyboard|mouse|lightgun|joystick]

       -dial_device, -dial [none|keyboard|mouse|lightgun|joystick]

       -trackball_device, -trackball [none|keyboard|mouse|lightgun|joystick]

       -lightgun_device [none|keyboard|mouse|lightgun|joystick]

       -positional_device [none|keyboard|mouse|lightgun|joystick]

       -mouse_device [none|keyboard|mouse|lightgun|joystick]
	      Each of these options controls auto-enabling the mouse, or  joy‐
	      stick  depending on the presence of a particular class of analog
	      control for a particular system. For example, if you specify the
	      option  -paddle mouse, then any system that has a paddle control
	      will automatically enable mouse controls	just  as  if  you  had
	      explicitly  specified -mouse.  Note that these controls override
	      the values of -[no]mouse, -[no]joystick, etc.

   Debugging options
       -[no]log
	      Creates a file called error.log which contains all of the inter‐
	      nal  log messages generated by the MESS core and system drivers.
	      The default is OFF (-nolog).

       -[no]verbose, -[no]v
	      Displays internal diagnostic information.  This  information  is
	      very  useful  for  debugging  problems  with your configuration.

	      mation when reporting bugs. The default is OFF (-noverbose).

       -[no]update_in_pause
	      Enables  updating  the screen bitmap while the system is paused.
	      This is useful for debuggin in some scenarios (and gets  in  the
	      way in others).  Default is OFF (-noupdate_in_pause).

       -[no]debug, -[no]d
	      Activates  the  integrated debugger. By default, the debugger is
	      entered by pressing the tilde (~) key during  emulation.	It  is
	      also  entered immediately at startup. The default is OFF (-node‐
	      bug).

       -debugscript filename
	      Specifies a file that contains a list of	debugger  commands  to
	      execute  immediately  upon startup. The default is NULL (no com‐
	      mands).

	      Specifies the font size to use for debugging.

       -[no]oslog
	      Outputs the error.log data to the system debugger. This  can  be
	      used  at	the  same  time as -log to output the log data to both
	      targets as well.	Default is OFF (-nooslog).

   Misc options
       -[no]drc
	      Enable DRC cpu core if available. Default is ON (-drc).

       -[no]drc_use_c
	      Force DRC use C backend. Default is OFF (-nodrc_use_c).

       -[no]drc_log_native
	      Write   DRC   native   disassembly   log.   Default    is    OFF
	      (-no_drc_log_native).

       -bios biosname
	      Specifies  the specific BIOS to use with the current system, for
	      systems that make use of a BIOS. The -listxml output  will  list
	      all  of  the  possible  BIOS  names for a system. The default is
	      'default'.

       -[no]cheat, -[no]c
	      Activates the cheat menu with autofire options and other	tricks
	      from  the  cheat	database,  if  present.   The  default	is OFF
	      (-nocheat).

	      default is OFF (-noskip_gameinfo).

       -uifont fontname
	      Specifies the name of a BDF font file to use for the UI font. If
	      this font cannot be found or cannot be loaded, the  system  will
	      fall  back  to  its built-in UI font. On some platforms fontname
	      can be a system font name  instead  of  a  BDF  font  file.  The
	      default is 'default' (use the OSD-determined default font).

       -ramsize, -ram value
	      Size of RAM (if supported by driver).

       -autoboot_command, -ab command
	      Command string to execute after machine boot (in quotes "").  To
	      issue a quote to the emulation, use """ in the string.  Using \n
	      will issue a create a new line, issuing what was typed prior  as
	      a command. Example: -autoboot_command "load """$""",8,1\n".

       -autoboot_delay [value]
	      Timer  delay  (in seconds) to trigger command execution on auto‐
	      boot.  Default is 2.
