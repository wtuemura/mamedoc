NAME
       jedutil - MAME JEDEC file utilities

SYNOPSIS
       jedutil [option]

DESCRIPTION
       Data for Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs) are usually stored in a for‐
       mat known as JEDEC, basically a text file allowing insertion of further
       information by programmers.

       MAME  uses  a  raw  binary representation of the same data, in order to
       achieve correct identification of PLD data through CRC and  SHA1  algo‐
       rithms (i.e. with the -romident option).

       jedutil	provides  an  easy  way to convert PLDs data between these two
       formats.

OPTIONS
       -convert inputfile outputfile [fuses]
	      Converts JEDEC data between file formats. Both .jed (JEDEC)  and
	      .pla  (Berkeley  standard  PLA) files can be converted to a .bin
	      (binary) file, while a binary file can be converted  to  a  .jed
	      file only.

       -view inputfile device
	      Dump  logic  equations.  inputfile can be either a JED or binary
	      file.

       -viewlist
	      View list of supported devices.
